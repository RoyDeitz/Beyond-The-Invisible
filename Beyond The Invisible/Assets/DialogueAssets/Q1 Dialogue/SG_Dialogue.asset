      I mean, you probably have, if you have such an equipment... Like the voices
      of dead people? Them saying something comprehensible, maybe even talking to
      you?

      He was speaking to... should I retell this? It's not like I thought this up
      or was hallucinating, you know? It was just too real.

    MessageText: Don't explain yourself, I believe you. I have seen that before.
      During the isolation people have everything they say recorded in some way,
      and sometimes we can hear recorded messages via radio. I belong to the State
      Institute of Radiotechnology and the Information Technologies. We are investigating
      this.

      I know it happens, but I've heard him saying things from the past. Things he
      has said long before all this happened, it couldn't have been recorded by any
      means. That's number one.

      to talk to the radio. Like I just shouted "do you hear me?", something along
      the lines. But it seemed he didn't get me. Or didn't hear me. I just heard
      him saying random sentences all the time.

      If you could find out how it works? If you find a frequency or how I can set

    MessageText: Yes. I got you. You see, such hasn't occured before. Usually the
      liminal crosstalk - that's how we call it - doesn't react to voice. If you
      haven't imagined it, of course. I will study this.

      So I've heard him speaking as if he was talking on the phone. He was an engineer,
      you see. And I've heard him discussing some diagram and that he'd like to have
      an appointment because he'd need to see an electrician for some advice on the
      circuits...

      that, by the way, because I have almost never seen her, had two times and that
      was enough for years!..

      time, I got a business trip in Naljchik offered...". And silence. I mean, static.
      I remember him saying that, he has called me like that around a year ago and
      has really had a business trip. Hasn't return home anytime soon, was sent to
      the front, can you imagine? I've lost him not one but two times, one can say...

      to the radio at that time, those were the last words I've heard from him. However
      long I called, I've heard of him no more. Will you try to find him again, please?
      Or, at least, just say where he is and what this whole thing was?..
